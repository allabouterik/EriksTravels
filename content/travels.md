    description: My first visit to the fantastic Chartres Cathedral. History of the Gothic cathedrals, first envisioned by Abbott Sugar of San Denis in 1044. He envisioned rib vaulting, flying buttresses, and large stained glass windows, among other innovations.  I set off to visit some of the most famous Gothic cathedrals in France. First stop, back to Chartres, the most perfectly preserved of all Gothic cathedrals. History and pictures of the cathedral. Next stop, Notre Dame de Paris, began in 1163, and damaged by the terrible fire of 2019. Amiens, the largest cathedral in France. A representation of pure high Gothic style. On to Reims, home of the coronation of French kings. The elaborate Loan Cathedral. Cathedral Saint-Etienne d’Auxerre. It’s construction was delayed over the centuries and the south tower was never completed. It’s built in the Burgundian style of Gothic. The cathedral of Bourges, built 1195 to 1230 is noteworthy for its great size. The cathedral of Beauvais. The town was over reaching in attempting to construct the tallest Gothic cathedral in France, but half of the cathedral collapsed in 1284, and again in 1573. It remains unfinished but is still spectacular, with some beautiful stained glass. My brief summary of the alluring power and beauty of these relics of a bygone era.
