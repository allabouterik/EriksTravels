      Come along with me aboard the Hurtigruten line, which has been delivering passengers, supplies, and mail up and down the coast of Norway for over a century. Starting in Bergen, we head northward far into the Arctic Circle, stopping at lots of small, charming towns, and villages along the way. Our cruise reaches the northern tip of Norway, only 750 miles from the north pole. The long rugged coastline offers beautiful scenery, with snow covered peaks, hills, green valleys, peninsulas, a thousand fiords, and 250,000 islands. It's a wonderful voyage. Come on along.
    details: >-
      We take the Hurtigruten cruise up the beautiful western coast of Norway. Ride the Funicular to the top of Mount Floyen for a spectacular view of Bergen. We cruised northward. Visits to the small towns of Alesund and Molde. Northward to Trondheim, where we see the Nidaros Cathedral and Stiftsgarden , one of the largest wooden building in Scandinavia. In Bodo, a visit to Saltstraumen, with one of the world's fastest tides. We enter the arctic circle with a shipboard ceremony on deck. The spectacular, narrow Trollfjord. The far north fishing port of Honningsvag. Drinks at the ice bar. A Viking dinner at a re-creation of the world's largest Viking longhouse in Lofoten. Visit to a Sami tent where we meet the couple Innuta and Io. A fantastic voyage.

    slug: seafood
    description: >-
      I've visited fish markets all over the world, and have always looked for the best seafood restaurants everywhere I've gone. Growing up the son of a Norwegian immigrant, maybe my love for fish has a genetic component. But my dad taught me to bait a hook, catch and clean fish, and how to deal with the small bones, so this passion has developed over many years. In this film, I've compiled some high points of my lifelong love affair with fish.
    details: >-
      Great fish markets. Tokyo, Maputo, Singapore, Busan, Gallipoli, Taipei, Zanzibar, Dubai, Hong Kong, Bergen, Cabo San Lucas, Borneo, Mangalore, and Morocco. Great seafood restaurants. Rinaldi's in Rome,Trishna in Mumbai, Portofino in Italy, and Marbella in Spain.

      I was born in Oak Park IL in 1940. It's on the outskirts of Chicago. Although I was the son of Norwegian immigrants, I think I had a pretty typical suburban midwestern American boyhood. In this little film, I share some of my memories from those good old days, which now seem so innocent and long ago.
    details: >-
      My boyhood in the 50s in Chicago. Playing cowboys and Indians. Roy, Rogers and Dale Evans. Erik's allergies and braces. An orchid for Eleanor Roosevelt. Phonograph records. Bozo the clown, Yuma Sumac, and the Calypsonian Blind Blake. 50s radio shows. The Shadow Knows, Inner Sanctum, and the low-down blues on WOPA. Movies. Cartoons and Serials. Erik the collector. YMCA camp. Lots of fishing. Scouting. Cub and Boy Scouts. The 1953 national jamboree in Irvine Ranch California. The Eagle Scout!

      There's no place remotely like Japan. It's a beautiful country. Everything you eat, see, hear, or do there is all uniquely and singularly Japanese. To the westerner, the people can seem quiet and inscrutable. They may seem distant, but they can be friendly. They're traditional but modern. Serious, but fun loving. Conservative, but sometimes wildly uninhibited. You can find both the pious and the profane. It's a fascinating destination!
    details: >-
      A brief history. Buddhism comes to Japan. Nara. The Todai-ji, largest bronze Buddha and wooden building in the world. Kinkaku-ji, the famous golden pavilion. Kyoto Imperial Palace. Nijo Castle, and the Nightingale floor. Old Kyoto. Kimonos. The bullet train. Humeji Castle, called The Great White Egret. Shinto shrines. Sumo at the Tokyo Arena. Kamakura and the famous Daibutsu Buddha. Tsukiji fish market. Sushi, Kobe beef, and Shabu- Shabu. Udon noodle making class. A taste of music and theater shows. Aomori and its' great illuminated paper floats. Kabukicho nightlife. The Robot Restaurant and its' wild and crazy show!

    slug: long-ago
    description: >-
      The rediscovery of the lone survivors of a lost archive of beautiful old photographs, moved me to begin work on my new film. 1/2 century ago, my girlfriend and I traveled the world together, taking pictures as we went. I haven't seen them in years. Working with the images allowed me to revisit some of the wonderful places we explored together, but also evoked bittersweet memories of the relationship and romance we shared when we were young and in love. I've entitled my new film, long ago and far away.
    details: >-
      A collection of beautiful photographs from the 1970s. Afghanistan and the Bamiyan Buddha. Egypt, Marrakesh, La Paz Bolivia, Hong Kong, Kenya, Jamaica, Haiti, Thailand, and Burma. Guatemala and Tikal. Nepal, Ecuadorian Indians. India. Calcutta, Khajuraho, Madras, Mahabalipuram, Varanasi, and Darjeeling. Peru. Cusco and Machu Picchu.

      Paris Film Festival Review: Long Ago and Far Away is a 15-minute short documentary by renowned music producer Erik Jacobsen. The title Long Ago and Far Away refers to two things: his relationship with his former girlfriend Cindy McCain during the 70s, and their trips together, all of it explored through photos taken all over the world during their relationship. Jacobsen, who doubles here as a nostalgic and sentimental narrator, elevates McCain's gorgeous photography with interesting facts and anecdotes to create a sort of slideshow of a past love, lost in the mountains and rivers of the most remote places in the world. Afghanistan, Bolivia, and Jamaica are only a few of the countries shown in this poetic short. The beautiful captures of landscapes, traditions, and cultures, the colorful clothing, the foods, and the villages all contribute to creating a moody, evocative film. The beginning of the film is quite unusual, with the director showing us a glimpse of his personal life before the documentary actually starts. The editing is quite simple, a clean succession of beautiful photos. The music is very well curated, which is exactly what we would have expected from a music connoisseur such as Jacobsen. A soft, gentle, and poetic short documentary that revisits Jacobsen's life with his former girlfriend Cindy McCain through their trips around the world.

      My wife and I traveled to Romania and joined up with her three sisters in Bucharest. Their mom was of Romanian heritage. Together, we took a road trip across the country, enjoying its natural beauty and interesting historical landmarks. We also visited several small towns that had once been home to the sister's family. We spent some time with their second cousin Anka, who still lives there. We all loved our brief sojourn in Romania, and the sisters got a little better understanding of where their family had come from.
    details: >-
      Bucharest. Churches, monasteries and the palace of Parliament. Headed out to Transylvania. The Palace Castle, Dracula's Castle, and Sighisoara, a beautiful, fortified medieval town. The Roma people. Romani palaces. The small towns of our Arpasu de Jos and Macedonia. Corbin's fairytale castle. Timisoara. Cathedral and fair.

      I spent forty years in the recording studio as a song publisher and record producer. Before that, I played five-string banjo in a small bluegrass group. We toured coast to coast. It was fun, but after several years, I put the banjo down, and began working in the studio producing records. At first, I recorded some of my compositions with my folk music friends: Mama Cass, Danny Doherty, Jerry Yester, Zal Yanovsky, and Henry Diltz. I found great songwriters and artists. Tim Hardin, John Sebastian, Norman Greenbaum, and, later, Chris Isaak. This is how I spent four decades! It was a journey with highs and lows, successes and failures. I got to know the artists, songwriters, and musicians, all with the talent and perseverance to live their lives making music. They all have my deep respect and admiration. It's not easy to do. I was lucky enough to be able to travel the world and I filmed musicians everywhere I went. Folkloric shows and street buskers alike. This film is a collection of live, on-location recordings I shot during my travels.
