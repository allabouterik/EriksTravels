    slug: seafood
    description: >-
      I've visited fish markets all over the world, and have always looked for the best seafood restaurants everywhere I've gone. Growing up the son of a Norwegian immigrant, maybe my love for fish has a genetic component. But my dad taught me to bait a hook, catch and clean fish, and how to deal with the small bones, so this passion has developed over many years. In this film, I've compiled some high points of my lifelong love affair with fish.

    description: >-
      My wife and I traveled to Romania and joined up with her three sisters in Bucharest. Their mom was of Romanian heritage. Together, we took a road trip across the country, enjoying its natural beauty and interesting historical landmarks. We also visited several small towns that had once been home to the sister's family. We spent some time with their second cousin Anka, who still lives there. We all loved our brief sojourn in Romania, and the sisters got a little better understanding of where their family had come from.

      Come along with me aboard the Hurtigruten line, which has been delivering passengers, supplies, and mail up and down the coast of Norway for over a century. Starting in Bergen, we head northward far into the Arctic Circle, stopping at lots of small, charming towns, and villages along the way. Our cruise reaches the northern tip of Norway, only 750 miles from the north pole. The long rugged coastline offers beautiful scenery, with snow covered peaks, hills, green valleys, peninsulas, a thousand fiords, and 250,000 islands. It's a wonderful voyage. Come on along.

  - title: Long Ago and Far Away
    slug: long-ago
    description: >-
      The rediscovery of the lone survivors of a lost archive of beautiful old photographs, moved me to begin work on my new film. 1/2 century ago, my girlfriend and I traveled the world together, taking pictures as we went. I haven't seen them in years. Working with the images allowed me to revisit some of the wonderful places we explored together, but also evoked bittersweet memories of the relationship and romance we shared when we were young and in love. I've entitled my new film, long ago and far away.

  - title: Japan
    slug: japan
    description: >-
      There's no place remotely like Japan. It's a beautiful country. Everything you eat, see, hear, or do there is all uniquely and singularly Japanese. To the westerner, the people can seem quiet and inscrutable. They may seem distant, but they can be friendly. They're traditional but modern. Serious, but fun loving. Conservative, but sometimes wildly uninhibited. You can find both the pious and the profane. It's a fascinating destination!

  - title: Erik's Midwestern Boyhood
    slug: boyhood
    description: >-
      I was born in Oak Park IL in 1940. It's on the outskirts of Chicago. Although I was the son of Norwegian immigrants, I think I had a pretty typical suburban midwestern American boyhood. In this little film, I share some of my memories from those good old days, which now seem so innocent and long ago.
